# WIDS

WIDS is a project created in order to increase security in wireless networks. The project consists of two main components: 
1. Rule based detections - original code for detecting popular attacks written on the basis of multiple papers + own testing 
2. Machine learning detections - model trained on the AWID3 dataset, tunned with custom data gathered by performing attacks in testing environment

 It operates on the 802.11 protocol and supports the most recent attack types. Open source solution allows you to use it according to your own needs. 
 Tool created for didactic purposes, however with proper configuration, it can be used as a tool for early alerting of threats in wireless networks.
